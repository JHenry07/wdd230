        <h2>All About Us</h2>
        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <p>Tanaka Farms began with Great-Grandfather Takeo, who was an Issei - first generation Japanese American - who immigrated from Hiroshima-ken, Japan in the early 1900s. After making the arduous journey to California, in 1922, his son, Farmer Grandpa George, who is a Nisei - second generation Japanese American- was born in Dinuba, California. His parents worked on a small farm as farm hands. </p>

            <p>In 1941 Farmer Grandpa George gets his own truck to ship produce in La Habra, California.</p>
            
            <p>But, in 1942 Farmer Grandpa George flees to Utah so he doesn't have to go into the WW2 Internment camps. While in Utah he meets his soon to be wife Grandma Chris!</p>
            
            <p>In 1945, after the end of World War 2, Grandpa George and Grandma Chris come back to Orange County and reside in Fountain Valley, where they farmed various properties with tomatoes, vegetables, and strawberries.</p>
            
            <p>In 1957 Farmer Tanaka was born in Fountain Valley.  Farmer Tanaka is a Sansei, a third generation Japanese American.</p>
            
            <p>From 1977 to the 1990s Farmer Tanaka grows wholesale tomatoes and strawberries. He even gets up to 300 acres and also starts his own packing and distribution across the country!</p>
        <h3>Our Mission and Values</h3>
        <h4>Our Mission</h4>
        <p>Here at Tanaka Farms, we strive to grow the best quality produce for you and your family. Not only do we want to grow great produce for you, we think it is absolutely necessary for everyone to know where their food is coming from and how it is being grown. This is why we strongly believe in educating children and adults alike with our farm tours. </p>
        <p>We want everyone who visits the farm to come away with a new found appreciation for food. We want to encourage more families to incorporate fresh produce into their lives and we believe that by providing a quality product and educating everyone about it, we can accomplish this.</p>
        
        <h4>What We Value</h4>
        <p><strong>Educating:</strong> Children and adults should know where their food is coming from, how it grows, why it’s good for them and that it is delicious! The more that a child sees and touches fruits and vegetables in their natural state, the more likely they are to eat it. It doesn’t matter how nutritious and beneficial produce is, if a child doesn't eat it, it’s not doing them any good.

        <p><strong>Entertaining:</strong> Here at the farm, we make eating fruits and vegetables fun with our tours. Children can especially benefit from learning through hands on experiences. Being in the field and seeing where their food is growing and tasting it is a memorable experience for a young child. We want children to come away from their experiences at the farm with a positive outlook on fruits and vegetables by making our tours fun and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
        <p><strong>Feeding:</strong> Food is life. At Tanaka Farms we care about the food we grow because we care about the people who are going to eat it. We strive to grow the best quality produce because we know that the health benefits of eating more plant based foods are endless but no one will eat it if it doesn’t taste good. The produce we grow is always seasonal, picked at the right time and on your table full of freshness and flavor. When you visit the farm and sample our produce, you’re often standing within a few feet of where it is growing, sometimes picking it directly from the vine yourself. At our market stand, you’re always getting the freshest product. We pick our produce fresh every morning so that you and your families will have the best tasting, seasonally grown fruits and vegetables.</p>
